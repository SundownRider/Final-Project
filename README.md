# Vulnerable Network Assessment

**Overview**

This repository showcases the assessment of a vulnerable computer network from the perspectives of both the red team and the blue team. The network consists of four machines including a vulnerable Linux machine running wordpress (Target 1), a Kali Linux machine (Kali) used to conduct a penetration test against the vulnerable wordpress machine, an ELK machine (ELK) desgined to capture attack logs from the vulnerable machine, and the machine designed for testing Kibana alerts (Capstone).
